# **Snatch & Flag**
This small project is part of another larger project named **Snatch & Flag.** Snatch & Flag is a videogame made in *Unity2D* engine promising a local PVP hack and slash action with only one PC.
- To be able to use this code to it's full potential you need:
  1. **Unity Engine** + **UnityHub**
  2. **My whole project** *(If you want to use, firstly install this repository on your devise, except for **.gitignore**, open **UnityHub** then select **Add Project** -> **From Disk** and select this project from your disk)* or some niche programing skills to be able to not only creat but arrange the object in Unity as they should be 
- But it can be done without my project because every piece of this C# script can be used in your own Unity2D project

If you liked to know more about the usage of some scripts. Try read some of my comments in those scripts *(path: Little-OMEGA/Assets/Mine/Script).* Maybe some of these comments will be usefull. You know, I am not great programmer let alone a good commentator. So I am sorry if you do not understand something *(It is maybe my fault).*
