# **Snatch & Flag**
This small project is part of another larger project named **Snatch & Flag.** Snatch & Flag is a videogame made in *Unity2D* engine promising a local PVP hack and slash action with only one PC.
- To be able to use this code to it's full potential you need **Unity Engine**
- My whole project (Unfortunately I was unable to deposit my project into GitHub) or some niche programing skills to be able to not only creat but arrange the object in Unity as they should be
- But it can be done because every piece of this C# script, in this project, can be used in your own Unity2D project

If you liked to know more about the usage of some scripts. Try read some of my comments in those scripts. Maybe some of them will be usefull. You know, I am not the best programmer let alone a good commentator.
